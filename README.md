# 🐧 Penguin Species Classifier - Streamlit ML App

Welcome to the **Penguin Species Classifier** — a simple yet powerful machine learning web app built using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a penguin is an **Adélie**, **Chinstrap**, or **Gentoo** based on a few biological features.

## 🔍 About the Project

This app takes input features such as **island**, **bill length**, **bill depth**, **flipper length**, **body mass**, and **gender** to classify the penguin species using a trained **Random Forest Classifier**.

It’s an interactive way to understand how machine learning models make predictions, and it showcases a clean deployment of an end-to-end ML pipeline.
